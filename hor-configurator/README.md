# Heralds of Ruin - Roster viewer and Pdf Generator

To use this, follow these simple steps:

1. Download and install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/

2. Run execute.bat (on first execution this will install some node modules so it might take a bit longer)

Choose one of the current rosters to view and download or upload your own roster.
If you want to upload your own roster, you need to create a JSON file that sticks to the warband interface.

You can find the warband interface definition here:
[Types definition](https://github.com/Labernator/HeraldsOfRuinCoopCampaigns/blob/master/hor-configurator/src/types.ts)

You can find the sample warband JSON files here:
[Folder with warband JSONs](https://github.com/Labernator/HeraldsOfRuinCoopCampaigns/tree/master/hor-configurator/src/data)

If you want to use other/new units you might need to add new weapons/rules etc. to the respective jsons. I will add stuff there over time.
